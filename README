This project gathers all the scripts I found useful for my daily tasks so far.

I usually save these scripts in my home bin folder (~/bin) making sure that 
folder is in the $PATH so then I can recall these scripts from every folder 
in the file system.

In order to be sure the scripts are executable you need to run the following command:
$ chmod +x <script-name>
